I felt honoured and pleased to present the topic "Digital transformation methods and challenges" to the leaders of Binh Phuoc province and neighboring provinces such as Binh Duong and Dak Nong, as well as to business leaders, at the conference on digital transformation which was co-hosted by Binh Phuoc Provincial People's Committee and the Ministry of Information and Communications of Vietnam.
