I'm happy to share that I'm starting a new role as HDR Coordinator in the School of Business & Management at RMIT Vietnam. In this role, I will lead and mentor both Ph.D. candidates and supervisors to pursue the university's HDR priorities and contribute to developing school-specific HDR strategies.
