I will lead the organisation of the 2022 Research Methodology Workshops, together with Prof. Bob Baulch, for PhD candidates and Early Career Researchers in the School of Business & Management - RMIT Vietnam. The event will take place from May 23 to May 26, including a panel discussion on strategies for research publications, joined by senior researchers in diverse disciplines and regions, and six workshops on research methodologies such as structural equation modelling, social network analysis, and data analytics for research by using R.
