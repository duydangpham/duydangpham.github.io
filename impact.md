Inspired by the <a href="https://researchwhisperer.org/2019/05/21/the-emerging-impact-landscape/" target="\_blank">blog post</a> by Wade Kelly on The Research Whisperer blog, I created this page to summarize my activities and their outcomes in each year, which I consider them to have certain impact either inside (internal) or outside (external) academia.
