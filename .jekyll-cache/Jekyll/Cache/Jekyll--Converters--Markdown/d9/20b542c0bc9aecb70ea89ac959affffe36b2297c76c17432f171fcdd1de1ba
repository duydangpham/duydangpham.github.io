I"-<p>As the number of new Covid-19 cases keeps increasing in Ho Chi Minh City (we are having on average 1,000+ new cases every day), my neighborhood entered quarantined mode a few days ago and we are not allowed to leave the house for at least 2 weeks. Here is the list of 5 things one would want to do during a lockdown, to keep life go on as normal as possible, that I want to share with you.<!-- excerpt --></p>

<h2 id="1-keep-your-living-space-clean-and-airy">1. Keep your living space clean and airy</h2>
<p>Since you are going to spend 2 weeks (or more) in the same living space, it makes a lot of sense to clean your space regularly. Open windows as much as possible to let in sunlight and fresh air. This will help you feel more comfortable when living in the space, and official health advice sources also recommend ensuring good ventilation in buildings to prevent Covid-19 (see for example https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/ventilation-and-coronavirus-covid-19).</p>

<h2 id="2-eat-healthy-and-be-prepared">2. Eat healthy and be prepared</h2>
<p>Try to maintain a healthy diet as much as possible. Don’t eat too much but don’t get too hungry either; eat until you feel full enough. Make sure to eat safe and minimize the risk of getting food poisoning. If delivery is allowed in your area during the lockdown, order some food that can be stored for a long time (you never know if the quarantine might get extended more than 2 weeks). I store plenty of ramens, crackers, and canned food, just in case.</p>

<h2 id="3-relax-and-do-something-productive">3. Relax and do something productive</h2>
<p>Relaxing is necessary to maintain a positive mood, especially for those who have been working hard around the clock before the lockdown happens. At the same time, finding something productive to do makes lockdown less boring. Don’t get me wrong, I believe that productivity should not be the top priority during this tough time, but I found reading books that I haven’t had the time to read or learning a new skill to be as relaxing as watching Netflix and gaming. Ultimately, keep yourself busy with the things that you enjoy doing and try not to let time pass through without doing anything.</p>

<h2 id="4-exercise-indoors">4. Exercise (indoors)</h2>
<p>I try to run on the treadmill for at least 30 minutes every day. Sometimes I do light weight lifting and cardio exercises indoor. I found exercising during the lockdown period to be good for me both physically and mentally. Make sure to do low-risk exercises and know your pace, so that you won’t hurt yourself. There are many exercises that you can do indoors to stay fit while minimizing physical interactions.</p>

<h2 id="5-stay-connected-online-and-follow-the-government-directives">5. Stay connected (online) and follow the government directives</h2>
<p>Lockdown stops us from enjoying social activities such as hanging out and seeing each other face-to-face, which can create negative moods. For me, I am fortunate to be in quarantine with my family, so we actually spend more time talking to each other these days than during normalcy. I also socialize with my friends and colleagues online via Facebook and via Teams, and occasionally we share some drinks online.</p>

<p>This pandemic creates a challenging time for all of us, and our collective discipline and self-awareness are needed to go back to normalcy. There is a time for everything, and now is the time for us to stay indoors, wear masks, look after our wellbeing, and follow the advice and directives from health experts and the government.</p>

<p>Take care and stay safe everyone!</p>
