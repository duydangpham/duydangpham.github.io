I"Q<p>As I thought that I should care more about my health, I bought a treadmill and after two months of regular running and walking on the treadmill, I lost 7 kgs. I used Apple Watch (Series 3 - not very accurate in fitness tracking based on what I have read) to keep track of my workouts and the Xiaomi Smart Scale 2 for measuring weights and other physical metrics, and all these data are synced and stored in the Appleâ€™s Health app on iPhone. Although the Health app provides useful analyses and visualizations of these data, we can export and analyze the data by using Python as well.</p>
