<h2 id="expertise">Expertise</h2>
<p>I completed my Ph.D. (Business Information Systems) degree at RMIT University (Australia) in May 2018, under the co-supervision of Dr. Siddhi Pittayachawan, Dr. Vince Bruno, and Professor Karlheinz Kautz. For my Ph.D. research, I proposed the use of social network analysis as an analytical and novel method to improve organizational information security, by identifying and leveraging organizational networks and key influencers within the workplace to increase information security awareness. I published <a href="/publications">14 research articles</a> on this topic in journals such as Information &amp; Management, Computers in Human Behavior, Computers &amp; Security, and conference proceedings such as ACIS and PACIS, as well as various <a href="/media">news articles</a>.</p>

<p>My teaching and research interests focus on the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">information security management &amp; behaviors</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">digital transformation</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">data analytics for business and education</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">algorithmic decision making &amp; algorithmic experience</li>
</ul>

<p>My research projects employed both quantitative and qualitative methods, and I am especially interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis" target="\_blank">social network analysis</a> methods, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_research" target="\_blank">action research</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_science_(methodology)" target="\_blank">design science</a> approaches.</p>

<p>I am <a href="/students">supervising several Ph.D. candidates</a>, and I always seek strong candidates who would like to do research in the areas listed above. Please find information about the Ph.D. programs and relevant contacts for further enquiries on this <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rmit.edu.vn%2Fresearch-supervisors-rmit-vietnam&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnpCoHibQT84cOWMBhVtSt-8mwSQ" target="\_blank">webpage</a>.</p>
