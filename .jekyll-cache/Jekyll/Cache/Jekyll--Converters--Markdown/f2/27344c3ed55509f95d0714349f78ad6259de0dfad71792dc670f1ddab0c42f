I"y<p>I felt great to be part of the RMIT Vietnam expert delivery team, consisting of 10 academic staff, and together we conducted an intensive, one-week executive training for Vietnamese Education officers and their Logistics partners, commissioned by Aus4Skills (through Dr. Kaye Eldridge).<!-- excerpt --></p>

<p>The training for Leading in the Age of Digital Disruption Vocational Education Training, was launched at RMIT Vietnam by the Australian Consul General. The training supports the College of Business and Law RMIT D3 strategy.</p>

<p>My session on AI, Machine Learning and Data Science for Digital Transformation was well received by the participants, as shown in the post-training evaluation survey. 
I was also glad to attend the presentations by the participants as a judge. The participants understood well the important use of AI, Machine Learning and Data Science for their digital transformation, and they proposed innovative plans to implement these technologies to meet their organisation’s strategic goals.</p>
