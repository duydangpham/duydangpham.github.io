I"z<p>In this semester 2, 2020, I am teaching a third-year course in the Bachelor of Engineering (Software Engineering) program called OENG1130 Technology Leadership. The first assignment of this course requires students to analyze the current issues of a technology company (students can flexibly pick the company), compare and discuss at least two leadership approaches, and provide recommendations related to the leadership approaches to address the identified issues. The first part of the assignment is a three-page research paper, and the second part involves delivering a 10-minute oral presentation about the research paper.</p>
