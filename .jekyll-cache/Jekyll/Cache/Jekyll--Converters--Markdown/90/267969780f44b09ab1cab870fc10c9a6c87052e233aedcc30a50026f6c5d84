I"<<p>The important role of Information Systems (IS) has been widely agreed by both academics and practitioners. In Vietnam, different information systems have been researched, developed, and applied. Given that, it is important to have a comprehensive book presenting Vietnamâ€™s IS research stories. The need of such a book is highlighted for summarizing the current frontiers of IS research and practices in Vietnam. It is further important to establish a shared vision of what we, as the whole IS research community, currently have and what future IS directions are.</p>
