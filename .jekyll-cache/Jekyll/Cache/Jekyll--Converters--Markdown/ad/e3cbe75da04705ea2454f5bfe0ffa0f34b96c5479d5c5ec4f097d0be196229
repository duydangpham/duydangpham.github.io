I"#<p>Students who transit from high school to university need to develop new habits and learn a lot of new things besides academic materials. Below are some tips to help first year students prepare for their learning journey in university<!-- excerpt -->:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Be proactive
As a university student, you need to be proactive. Don’t be afraid or shy to ask for help or clarification - if something is unclear, you should ask away. I have taught first year students who made false assumptions about assignment requirements and failed to address these requirements. Being proactive also means that you are responsible for the work that you are doing and plan it properly. For instance, if you anticipate not being able to submit your work on time or encounter some difficulties in your study, it is best to raise the issues to the lecturer as soon as possible.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Be independent
Being independent means you can rely on yourself to get the work done. It also means that you don’t need to be constantly</p>
