<p>Some of my notes on teaching, research, and leadership, based on personal experiences (as an early career academic/manager).<!-- excerpt --></p>

<h1 id="on-teaching">On teaching:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The first priority is to help students understand the materials and achieve the intended learning outcomes (e.g., if the lesson’s objective is teaching students to define, implement, and evaluate a method, were students able to do all these tasks after the lesson?). Second, pique their interest and curiosity, and inspire them to explore and dive deep into the topics in their own time and outside of the class.</li>
  <li>In line with the above priorities, engagement and empowerment are critical. Therefore, it is important to make learning a process to co-create and co-discover knowledge, which facilitates engagement and empowerment (<a href="http://www.bu.edu/ctl/guides/experiential-learning/">Kolb’s experiential learning approach</a> is a good reference for creating this process).</li>
  <li>Ultimately, students are equipped with the knowledge and skill sets to succeed in their future endeavors (e.g., job or further study), and are inspired to develop further their mastery on completion of the course(s) or program.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="on-research">On research:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Aim for impact while publishing high-quality research in premier outlets. Think about how the research can impact society and industry e.g., change or inform practices, or improve the current situation.</li>
  <li>For early career researchers, develop and work on a second research interest (should be related to the primary and first research interest from Ph.D. research). Also, prioritize expanding research collaboration beyond the home institution and former Ph.D. supervisors.</li>
  <li>Writing applications for research funding is now added as a research priority besides publications and research supervision.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="on-leadership">On leadership:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Embrace forward thinking.</li>
  <li>Focus on making incremental, quick, and easy-to-realize wins that are linked to the strategic objectives; this approach is good for maintaining team morale while creating impacts at the same time (think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen">Kaizen</a>).</li>
  <li>Practice <a href="https://hbr.org/1973/03/what-managers-think-of-participative-leadership">participative leadership</a> - encourage people to propose and own their initiatives. Discuss strategic objectives and hear from people how these objectives should be best achieved.</li>
</ul>
