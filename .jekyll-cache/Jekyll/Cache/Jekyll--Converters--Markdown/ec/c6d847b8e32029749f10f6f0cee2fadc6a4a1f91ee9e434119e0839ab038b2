<h2 id="success-factors-and-challenges-of-algorithmic-decision-making-in-healthcare">Success factors and challenges of algorithmic decision-making in healthcare</h2>
<p>As data-driven technologies are widely adopted in different settings, scholars and practitioners have recently studied aspects of algorithmic decision-making (ADM), or the process where decisions are made either directly by the algorithms or by a human decision-maker supported by algorithms. In either case, many concerns have been raised regarding the fairness, transparency, accuracy, accountability, data privacy, and security of ADM, to name a few. More importantly, these concerns need to be addressed when ADM is applied in critical contexts such as healthcare. This doctoral research project will employ a mixed-methods approach to explore the success factors and challenges associated with the existing or potential use of ADM in healthcare from the perspective of users. The project would contribute practical implications for designing ADM process and data-driven healthcare technologies that are both useful and acceptable to societies.</p>

<p>Applicants for this project will be based on the RMIT Vietnam campus, but will be enrolled through RMIT Australia as offshore candidates.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-user-security-behaviour-in-wfh-context---a-toe-approach">Exploring user security behaviour in WFH context - A TOE Approach</h2>
<p>Many organizations around the globe have let their employees work from home, especially due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which expose these organizations to various information security risks in the employees’ work environment at home. While prior research has examined the cognitive factors that influenced the information security behaviors of remote workers, little was known about the impact of the different work environments on these behaviors. Moreover, organizations and employees are abruptly forced to embrace working from home, which create unprecedented problems and inconvenience in how employees perform daily work at home that could jeopardize organizational information security. This project proposes to adapt the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework to investigate the factors that influence how employees protect organizational information security while working from home during an extended period. In terms of theoretical implications, the project focuses on exploring the contextual and situational factors that influence employee information security behaviors.</p>

<h2 id="digital-transformation-and-digitalisation-of-healthcare-in-vietnam">Digital transformation and digitalisation of healthcare in Vietnam</h2>
<p>Digital transformation and the digitalisation of processes, which leverage digital technologies to optimise existing operations and create improvements, have been rapidly taking place in organisations of all sizes and across different sectors. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact societies around the world, the healthcare sector is put under pressure to adopt digital technologies to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for citizens of all ages. Nevertheless, the extant literature has shown that digital transformation programs are often large and complex, and contextual i.e., there is no one-size-fits-all solution for digital transformation across different contexts.</p>

<p>This doctoral research project will employ a mixed method approach to examine the success factors and challenges in the adoption of digital technologies from both the perspectives of healthcare centres (e.g., hospitals and clinics) and relevant stakeholders (e.g., doctors, nurses, professional staff, as well as patients and policy makers). Furthermore, it involves developing and delivering a comprehensive training program to enhance digital transformation capabilities of healthcare centres and staff in Vietnam. The project will put forward a validated framework that outlines the best practices for digital transformation and digitalisation in the healthcare context.</p>

<p>The PhD candidate(s) working on this project will be mentored by experienced and senior researchers who have established research track records in the digital transformation and digitalisation areas. The candidate(s) will also have access to networks of researchers in the Managing Smart Transformation research cluster at RMIT Vietnam and RMIT Australia, as well as healthcare centres and medical professionals in Vietnam.</p>

<h2 id="social-marketing-approach-in-encouraging-employee-security-compliance">Social Marketing Approach in encouraging employee security compliance</h2>
<p>Understanding the behavioral change process of system users to adopt safe security practices is important to the success of an organization’s cybersecurity program. Internal marketing is an effective strategy to enhance organizational capabilities and competencies, by influencing employees’ attitudes and behaviors towards organizational goals. Social marketing adopts the concepts and techniques of commercial marketing to influence target audiences to adopt or sustain behavior in pursuit of social goals such as in increasing pro-environmental behavior, health related behavior, and service quality. Internal social marketing (ISM) combines social and internal marketing, applying internal marketing to influence employees’ attitude and behavior towards organizational changes, but to aiming to achieve social, rather than commercial objectives. This study aims to apply 7Ps marketing mix, as part of an ISM approach, and measure its effectiveness on employee compliance behaviour. This understanding could inform the design of behavioral infrastructure to promote and maintain cybersecurity compliance.</p>
