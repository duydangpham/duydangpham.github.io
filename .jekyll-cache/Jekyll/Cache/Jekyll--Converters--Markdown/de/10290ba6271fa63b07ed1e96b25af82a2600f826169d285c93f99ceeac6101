<p><a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/courses/004073" target="\_blank">COSC2083 Introduction to Information Technology</a></p>

<p>This course aims to provide you with the foundation knowledge of contemporary Information Technology areas, software, applications and job skills required to enter the IT market. A major component of the course is the practical application of the knowledge gained from the theoretical content. The material covers a broad range of introductory Information Technology concepts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/courses/049805" target="\_blank">COSC2652 User-centred Design</a></p>

<p>This is an introductory course to user-centred design and usability experience. User-centred design is a design methodology that focuses on the needs of end users, limitations of end users, preferences of end users, and business objectives. This course is concerned with the development of interactive systems with a strong focus on user-centred design and usability principles. You will learn what characteristics of a user interface can make it easy or hard for people to use, and how to design user interfaces that take into account human capabilities and constraints. The emphasis will be on design first (iteratively, on paper or with prototyping tools). The design principles you learn here will be applied in the follow up courses in web and mobile application development.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/courses/049802" target="\_blank">COSC2634 Building IT Systems</a></p>

<p>IT today is everywhere and is involved in many aspects of life, including mobile devices, electronic voting and robotic fish. Many advances have come from people passionately following an inspiration, and developing it into a concrete outcome. This course is an opportunity for you to pursue an idea in IT and to work with a team of like-minded people to develop it. You will be provided with assistance to choose an appropriate topic, find a project team, generate a project plan, and to implement your project. This course is designed to engage and inspire you with the wide world of IT, with a particular emphasis on finding appropriate tools, methodologies and techniques to meet your own personal challenge.</p>

<p>This course will give you substantial hands-on, practical learning experiences and aims to motivate you through engagement in the creative, explorative and meaningful development of technological artefacts that operate in real world contexts.</p>

<p>This is a project-based course.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/courses/014058" target="\_blank">COSC2130 Professional Computing Practice</a></p>

<p>This course is an introduction to computing ethics, law and marketing. It is intended for CSIT students who have not studied business principles, or who have little work experience in industry. The course provides a survival kit for CSIT graduates entering the workforce. During this course, you should consider computing ethical issues, such as information privacy, computer crime, computer terrorism. During this course, you should also consider the international legal framework available to protect software system development. This includes non-disclosure agreements, employment contracts, intellectual property law (copyright, patent, licensing, royalties), trademarks and warranty disclaimers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www1.rmit.edu.au/courses/051213" target="\_blank">OENG1130 Technology Leadership</a></p>

<p>The course covers effective methodologies to devise real solutions for challenges faced by today’s technology leaders. It also covers processes, operations and understanding company infrastructure and developing flexibility for change. The course will involve engaging in a real technology environment and acquiring the skills and knowledge for a successful technical leader.</p>

<p><a href="http://www1.rmit.edu.au/courses/051198" target="\_blank">COSC2658 Data Structures and Algorithms</a> | 
<a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/courses/004302" target="\_blank">COSC2469 Algorithms and Analysis</a></p>

<p>The main objective of this course is for you to acquire the tools and techniques necessary to propose practical algorithmic solutions to real-world problems which still allow strong theoretical bounds on time and space usage. You will study a broad variety of important and useful algorithms and data structures in different areas of applications, and will concentrate on fundamental algorithms. You will spend a significant time on each algorithm to understand its essential characteristics and to respect its subtleties.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/courses/051831" target="\_blank">COSC2753 Machine Learning</a></p>

<p>Machine Learning involves automatically identifying patterns in data to suggest future predictions about a task: e.g., predicting future house prices from historical data and trends. The explosion of data in different fields, such as health and finance, and in sources such as social media, has made Machine Learning an increasingly core Computer Science competency, with many companies investing in data analytics and the world’s major IT companies (such as Google, Facebook, and others) establishing Machine Learning labs.</p>

<p>This course will introduce the basic Machine Learning concepts, covering supervised and unsupervised techniques, evaluation, as well as specific approaches such as deep neural networks. Students will learn how to apply such techniques to a range of problems, using open source Machine Learning toolkits, and learn how to analyse outputs from the applications. Students will perform assignments that involve a variety of real world datasets from a variety of domains.</p>

<h3>School of Business IT and Logistics (2014 – 2017)</h3>
<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/courses/008219" target="\_blank">OMGT1082 Introduction to Logistics and Supply Chain Management</a></p>

<p>In this introductory course you will explore the elements of integrated business logistics and the role and application of logistics principles to supply/demand/value chain management. Logistics and the closely related concept of supply chain management (SCM) underpin business or corporate strategy as far as the latter sets company objectives in sales, market share, share price, returns on shareholder funds, investment and assets. The course also covers key activities related to logistics and supply chain management, including transportation, warehousing, inventory management, customer service, and purchasing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/courses/039992" target="\_blank">OMGT2146 Supply Chain Analysis and Design</a></p>

<p>This course provides an introduction to quantitative methods that can be used in industry. You will acquire advanced spreadsheet and database modelling skills. The course will introduce static and dynamic models of supply chains and logistics systems. Specifically, it will apply transport and transhipment models to optimize supply chains. The course will enhance your appreciation of logistics and the usefulness of mathematical and statistical models in solving logistics problems. You will learn to think systematically about the fundamental processes involved and to evaluate the performance of a supply chain as a system. You will also develop your critical thinking skills to the point where you are able to deliberate on contemporary issues in supply chain management.</p>
