**Doctor of Philosophy**
The minimum requirements for admission to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program are:

- a bachelor's degree requiring at least four (4) years of full-time study in a relevant discipline awarded with honours. The degree should include a research component comprised of a thesis, other research projects or research methodology subjects that constitute at least 25% of a full time (or part time equivalent) academic year. The applicant must have achieved at least a distinction average in the final year; or
- a master's degree that includes a research component comprised of at least 25% of a full time (or part time equivalent) academic year with an overall distinction average; or
- a master's degree without a research component with at least a high distinction average; or
- evidence of appropriate academic qualifications and/or experience that satisfies the ADVC RT&D or nominee that the applicant has developed knowledge of the field of study or cognate field and the potential for research sufficient to undertake the proposed program.

At RMIT a grade of Distinction represents academic achievement of 70% or higher and a High Distinction is 80% or higher.
