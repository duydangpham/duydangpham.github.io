Welcome to my personal website!

I am a **Senior Lecturer** at <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.vn/about-us/schools-and-centres/the-business-school" target="\_blank">The Business School</a>, RMIT University (Saigon South Campus, Vietnam), where I teach and conduct research in the field of Management Information Systems (MIS).

In addition to my teaching and research roles, I serve as the **Associate Head of Department (Research)** within the school, providing leadership to enhance research excellence, foster a collaborative and innovative research culture, and support academic staff and PhD candidates in advancing their research agendas. My role involves facilitating research initiatives, mentoring early-career researchers, and driving the department's strategic research priorities, including securing external research funding and strengthening industry engagement.

Prior to my current role, I served as **HDR Coordinator & Delegated Authority** in TBS, managing six PhD programs across various business and management disciplines. Before transitioning to TBS, I was teaching and conducting research in the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.vn/our-schools-centres/school-science-technology" target="\_blank">School of Science, Engineering &amp; Technology</a>, where I was the **Senior Program Manager** managing their two flagship programs, Bachelor of IT and Bachelor of Software Engineering.

As an MIS scholar and practitioner, my conversations and writing cover areas such as:
- Information security governance and behaviors
- Digital transformation and digitalization
- Digital innovations and technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, blockchains, Internet of Things)

I'm privileged to collaborate with brilliant [PhD candidates](/teaching) on various MIS and management research topics.

Together with my research partners, I have written/co-authored over 60 [articles](/publications) for internationally recognized research journals and conferences (available on my <a href="https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?hl=en&user=lkYFFvAAAAAJ" target="\_blank">Google Scholar profile</a>). We have also acquired successfully a total [research funding](/_projects/) amount of approximately US$ 341,500 (up to 2023).

In 2024, I was honored to be appointed <b><a href="https://www.gonzaga.edu/news-events/stories/2024/8/12/meet-fulbright-scholar-in-residence-duy-dang" target="\_blank">Fulbright Scholar-in-Residence</a></b> at the <a href="https://www.gonzaga.edu/school-of-business-administration/undergraduate/business-administration/management-information-systems" target="\_blank">School of Business Administration</a>, Gonzaga University, USA.
