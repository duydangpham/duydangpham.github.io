Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Senior Lecturer in <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.vn/about-us/schools-and-centres/the-business-school" target="\_blank">The Business School</a>, RMIT University (Saigon South Campus, Vietnam), where I am teaching and conducting research in the management information systems (MIS) areas, while managing six Doctoral programs under the business & management disciplines.

Prior to my current roles, I was teaching and conducting research in the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.vn/our-schools-centres/school-science-technology" target="\_blank">School of Science, Engineering &amp; Technology</a>, where I was also spearheading their Bachelor of IT and Bachelor of Software Engineering programs.

As an MIS educator and researcher, my conversations and writing cover areas such as:
- Information security governance and behaviors
- Digital transformation and digitalization
- Digital innovations and technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, blockchains, Internet of Things)

I'm privileged to collaborate with brilliant [PhD candidates](/teaching) on various MIS and management research topics, including five candidates under current supervision and another three graduates.

Together with my research partners, I have written/co-authored over 60 [articles](/publications) for internationally recognized research journals and conferences (available on my <a href="https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?hl=en&user=lkYFFvAAAAAJ" target="\_blank">Google Scholar profile</a>). We have also acquired successfully a total [research funding](/_projects/) amount of approximately US$ 341,500 (up to 2023).

In 2024, I was honored to be appointed <a href="https://fulbrightscholars.org/sir" target="\_blank">Fulbright Scholar-in-Residence</a> at the <a href="https://www.gonzaga.edu/school-of-business-administration/undergraduate/business-administration/management-information-systems" target="\_blank">School of Business Administration</a>, Gonzaga University, USA.

Beyond academia, I am:
- Co-founder of the <a href="https://vn-ais.org/" target="\_blank">Vietnam Chapter of Association for Information Systems (VAIS)</a>
- Consultant for digitalization projects
- Trainer for digital literacy and cybersecurity programs for government agencies and corporate entities
- Research Lead for a <a href="https://genderdiversity.vn/" target="\_blank">gender equality and inclusion program</a> funded by the US Consulate General in Vietnam
- Visiting Lecturer for MBA programs at international and local universities in Vietnam
- Managing my personal investments

I write and share my thoughts and reflections (in Vietnamese) on various topics about life and careers on a <a href="https://duydangpham.substack.com/" target="\_blank">Substack blog</a>, with the ambition to compile a personal playbook (inspired by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Almanack-Naval-Ravikant-Wealth-Happiness/dp/1544514212" target="\_blank">the Almanack of Naval Ravikant</a>).
