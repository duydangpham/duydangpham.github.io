The School of Business & Management successfully organised a virtual training workshop for 200 staff from Vietnam Airlines on Friday, September 17, with introductions from Ms. Loan Duong Hong and the Government Affairs team.

The Schoolâ€™s Academic Team, led by Professor Mathews Nkhoma included Associate Professor Trung Nguyen, Professor Robert (Bob) McClelland, Dr. Duy Dang, and Dr. Hiep Pham, who provided a workshop on the topic of "Digital Transformation and Cyber Security Management". Digital transformations are shaping the world and the workplace as we know it, bringing greater interconnectedness among people, organisations, and machines, as well as enhanced speed and agility, but also posing a significant leadership challenge.<!-- excerpt -->

Leaders in this fast-paced digital era must consider new skills and mindset modifications as they navigate the dynamic challenges of blurred borders, fluid collaborations, and agility pressures. This workshop aimed to help participants grasp important leadership concerns in the digital era and acquire the abilities necessary to lead in a world where digital disruption is the norm.

Delegates at the event also had the honor of receiving the keynote speeches from Professor Peter Coloe, Chairman of RMIT Vietnam, and Mr. Dang Ngoc Hoa, Chairman of Vietnam Airlines, as well as welcoming the Deans of respective Schools, including Professor Julia Gaimster from SCD and Professor Brett Kirk from SST.
