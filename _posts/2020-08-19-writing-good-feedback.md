Characteristics of good assessment feedback:
- Constructive and actionable i.e., provide specific suggestions that contribute to improvements
- Encouraging tone; always appreciate the good points/strengths first before analyzing the weakness/limitations
- 'Should', 'may', 'might' over 'must' or 'has to' 
- Stimulate thinking over being prescriptive
