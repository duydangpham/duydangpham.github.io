It has been 3 months since I was appointed to the Senior Program Manager position which involves managing two undergraduate programs - the Bachelor of IT and Bachelor of Engineering (Software Engineering). These 3 months passed by rather quickly as I have been involved quite a number of tasks in different domains. So, I make some quick notes about the kinds of tasks that I have performed so far in this position, for those who would like to understand more about what an academic manager would do or those who are considering to becoming one.

1. Program management
Basically this means ensuring the two programs are running smoothly. Program management involves managing of teaching teams, course allocation and planning, and managing facilities and equipment (e.g., software, teaching tools, IoT consummables).

2. Leadership
The obvious parts of leadership include proposing initiatives and being in charge of implementing them. Proposing initiatives requires understanding thoroughly the programs and their operations and issues. Some issues are new and need data collection to discover, whereas the others would likely be existing leftovers from your predecessor(s). It is a good practice to identify these issues and resolve them quickly so that you can focus on resolving new issues.
