Since its release in 1969, The Godfather has made an indelible mark on American crime fiction. From the mind of master storyteller Mario Puzo, it traces the Corleone family, whose brilliant and brutal portrayal illuminated the violent and seductive allure of power in American society. A tale of family and loyalty, law and order, obedience and rebellion, it has stood the test of time as the definitive novel of the Mafia underworld.
 
Beyond the bestselling novel, Francis Ford Coppolaâ€™s incomparable film adaptation and Academy Award winner for Best Picture cemented The Godfather's reputation as a triumph in storytelling and a seminal classic for the ages. With a legacy of blood and honor, it is a cultural touchstone that has resonated for generations, and still mesmerizes readers to this day.
