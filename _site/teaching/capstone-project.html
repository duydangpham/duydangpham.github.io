<hr />

<p><strong>Capstone project</strong> is an integral part of the Bachelor of IT and the other Bachelor degrees in Engineering, in which final year students form multi-disciplinary teams to work on a significant project that lasts for 6+ months, <strong>from March to September</strong> every year.</p>

<p>Most of these capstone projects are provided by industry partners based on their real business needs and practical problems. Students can also work on capstone projects submitted by faculty members as part of their research agenda, which often lead to a research publication.</p>

<p>The objective of the capstone projects is to assess the students’ knowledge and skills that are accumulated throughout their academic years, including teamwork, project management, report writing and verbal presentation. Students completing the capstone projects are ready for work and for pursuing postgraduate research study if needed.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-get-from-giving-capstone-projects-to-students">What do I get from giving capstone projects to students?</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>1. Prototyping your solutions</strong></dt>
  <dd>Many industry partners have benefitted from working with our IT and Engineering students in the capstone projects as a fast and cost-saving way to prototype their business solutions. We have the work integrated learning (WIL) agreement which serves the purpose of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to protect your intellectual properties (IPs). Companies have also enjoyed sharing fresh ideas with not only our students but also faculty members who are specialised in areas such as data science, big data, software engineering, and large-scale system development etc.</dd>
  <dt><strong>2. Recruiting high quality technical graduates</strong></dt>
  <dd>Our IT and Engineering students are well trained in their technical areas and proficient in English communication, teamwork, and project management. They are proactive and have a can-do attitude, as well as strong work ethics. By working with our students in their capstone projects, you can evaluate the students over 6 months, and many of our students received job offers from the companies at the end of the projects.</dd>
  <dt><strong>3. Nurturing the next generations of the workforce</strong></dt>
  <dd>We are honoured to collaborate with your organisation in the capstone projects, and in doing so, we are nurturing together the next generations of the high-quality IT and Engineering workforce in the future. Our University’s strategic plan aims to make our students <strong>Ready for Life and Work</strong>, and to espouse this vision, we put top priority in collaborating with companies and communities to create work integrated learning (WIL) experiences for our students.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="how-do-i-get-involved-in-capstone-projects">How do I get involved in capstone projects?</h2>
<p>We welcome startups, small and medium sized companies, large enterprises, and non-profit organisations to give capstone projects to our students. Please do not hesitate to contact me at my email address <a href="duy.dangphamthien@rmit.edu.vn">duy.dangphamthien@rmit.edu.vn</a> to get started.</p>

<p>By offering a capstone project, we would also like to build a great professional relationship between our <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.vn/our-schools-centres/school-science-technology" target="\_blank">School of Science &amp; Technology</a> with your organisation, which leads to other opportunities such as collaboration in research &amp; development (R&amp;D), co-design and co-delivery of courses, as well as internship.</p>

<h2 id="student-profiles--case-studies">Student profiles &amp; case studies:</h2>
<p>Students who enrol in the capstone project courses are in their final year of the degree, which imply that they possess advanced technical skills and knowledge gained from completing specialised courses such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>machine learning</li>
  <li>embedded systems</li>
  <li>programming IoT</li>
  <li>advanced web and mobile development</li>
  <li>cloud technologies</li>
</ul>

<p>The multi-disciplinary capstone project teams usually comprise 4 to 5 students in the following degrees:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bachelor of IT</li>
  <li>Bachelor of Engineering (Software Engineering) (Honours)</li>
  <li>Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronics) (Honours)</li>
  <li>Bachelor of Engineering (Robotics and Mechatronics) (Honours)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the recent years, we have had the privilege to collaborate with key industry partners in Vietnam and Australia, which ranged from startups to large enterprises such as Intel, Bosch, ABB, KMS Technology, Navigos, Vietcetra, Quod AI, and OUCRU/Hospital for Tropical Diseases.</p>

<p>We have received positive feedback from our industry partners and our students completed impactful capstone projects. Some capstone projects have also resulted in research publications co-authored by the students and their supervisors, which were accepted for publication in international conference proceedings.</p>
