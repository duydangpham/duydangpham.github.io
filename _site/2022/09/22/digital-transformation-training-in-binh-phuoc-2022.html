<p> </p>

<p>So what were the key points in my presentation?</p>

<p>First, SMEs lack almost everything - finance, technological infrastructures, and digital personnel. Digital transformation often requires some level of investment and digital transformation projects can be very risky, so such endeavour to transform is not quite matching with the characteristics of SMEs. In return, SMEs can manage changes more easily than large corporations do. Their decision-making is concentrated on the CEO, who usually happens to be the person having the most interest in the survival of their business.</p>

<p>Sticking to the reality, the limited capital of SMEs has to be spent wisely. The key to digital transformation for SMEs then, I would argue, revolves around 1) selecting the digital initiatives to be experimented and 2) how these initiatives are measured. The concept that “digital transformation starting from leadership”, which has been considered important before, is even more critical for SMEs’ owners. Digital leadership and awareness are also the key here.</p>

<p>Digital transformation should not focus on digital technology, but on digital strategy, people, processes, and data. As for digital strategy, SMEs should focus on building their digital transformation capabilities step by step. Come up with a roadmap for digital transformation that has specific stages - digitising processes, products, services, and business models, so that the transformation journey can be managed more effectively. The reflection ability of the SME owner, and of the organization as a whole, plays an important role in this process.</p>

<p>I quite like the story of digital transformation of SMEs because this topic is very much practical in Vietnam, where over 80% of businesses are SMEs. In the coming October, I am planning to organise a workshop on digital transformation for F&amp;B businesses, which I found to be another interesting topic.</p>
